        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I am a dedicated computational biology researcher with a robust
          foundation in bioinformatics, algorithm development, and large-scale
          multiomic data integration. I possess deep expertise in machine
          learning, statistical modeling, electronics, and software engineering,
          complemented by proficiency in systems biology, network analysis, and
          high-dimensional data interpretation. My experience spans
          interdisciplinary collaborations in immunology, genomics, and
          biomedical engineering, where I have developed and applied
          cutting-edge tools to solve complex biological challenges.
          <br /><br />I am skilled in advanced programming languages, cloud
          computing platforms, AR/VR technologies, and full-stack development,
          alongside innovative data visualization techniques that drive
          actionable insights. Passionate about unraveling intricate biological
          mechanisms, I leverage eletronics, computational simulations, pathway
          enrichment analyses, and high-performance computing to enhance
          understanding of cellular processes. Committed to advancing the
          frontiers of biomedical science, I continuously explore the
          intersection of computational and experimental research to address the
          most pressing challenges in health and disease.

          <br /><br />I am a curious tinkerer with a passion for exploring how
          things work and finding ways to improve them. From coding algorithms
          and designing visualizations to hands-on problem-solving, I enjoy
          experimenting across disciplines. My broad interests keep me adaptable
          and open to new ideas, enabling me to approach challenges creatively
          and uncover practical solutions.

          <em>Research Intern</em> (Jul 2024 - Present)<br />
          Mentor: Dr. Vinay S. Mahajan (BWH Division of Engineering in

            >Project: Epigenomic Analysis of CD4+ CTL Differentiation in
            IgG4-related Disease</strong
          ><br />
          In this project, I developed advanced bioinformatics pipelines to
          conduct a multiomic study on human CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
          differentiation in IgG4-related disease. By integrating whole genome
          bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq,
          and enhancer RNA sequencing datasets, I identified key epigenomic and
          transcriptomic regulators driving CD4+ CTL differentiation. This
          research uncovered novel enhancer regions and CpG methylation
          signatures, with implications for understanding autoimmune diseases
          and improving cancer immunotherapy strategies.

            >Project: Algorithm Development for Gene Regulatory Network
            Analysis</strong
          ><br />
          I developed a multilayer network analysis framework using the
          Multi-Dimensional HITS (MD-HITS) algorithm to analyze temporal gene
          regulatory networks (GRNs) in cell differentiation. This framework was
          applied to T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation, integrating
          ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility and RNA-seq data to map
          transcriptional regulators. My approach identified crucial regulatory
          nodes and pathways in Tfh cell lineage specification, outperforming
          other GRN centrality ranking methods. This work, presented at ISMB
          Montreal 2024, provided both computational insights and biological
          significance.

          Mentor: Dr. Kaushal Kumar Bhagat (IVAR Lab)<br />

          I implemented machine learning models for real-time pose estimation
          and gesture tracking, developing AR/VR applications for medical
          education and interactive learning. Additionally, I led project teams,
          managed development cycles, and contributed to open-source educational
          software. This work culminated in a co-authored research publication
          with Dr. Christian Moro from Bond University, Australia.

        <p>
          <strong>HDI Global SE, Tokyo, Japan</strong><br />
          <em>Software Intern (on-site, Tokyo branch)</em> (Mar - Aug 2023)<br />
          <em>Automation and Deployment Engineer (remote contractor)</em> (Sept
          2023 - Feb 2024)<br />
          During my time in Tokyo, I automated complex insurance policy
          generation processes, significantly improving efficiency and achieving
          a time savings of over 40 hours per policy. This was accomplished
          through the design and implementation of streamlined data extraction
          and validation systems. I also contributed to improving client
          interactions and operational workflows, leading to reduced processing
          errors and enhanced business efficiency. Additionally, I provided
          remote oversight, managing ongoing product operations for the home
          branch in Germany, ensuring smooth deployment and integration of
          processes.
